      Hello World! My name is
      <strong> Srinithi Doddapaneni </strong> and I am a first year
      <em> Computer Science </em> major <br />
      I'm from the Bay Area, specifically <em> San Ramon </em>. I love hiking,
      playing basketball for fun, spending time in nature, listening to music,
      playing chess, and solving puzzles. One fun fact about me is that I've
      kept every single <br/>
      letter written to me since 1st grade.
      <p>
        I am excited for this opportunity with Hack4Impact and build projects to
        make a positive impact for nonprofits in SLO.
